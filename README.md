# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# 3D Portfolio

this is the prototype of original portfolio.
The implementation of 3D Portfolio will be used later on.
I'm planning to change the portfolio image. 

## Contact section

The design of this contact section will be made later on.
We will mix the color to make beautiful contact section
